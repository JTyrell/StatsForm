This is a formal test of creating webforms and storing that data for later analysis. This test was based on an assignment my 
younger sibling got for Basic Statisical calculations in Mathematics at the primary level. The data (individuals Easter
activity of Choice) was to be collected and presented the mean, mode and median as well as the tally of those that preferred
a certain activity in the lists based on the types provided. I opted to help with the data gathering by creating a page where 
the choice would be entered by friends and family not present to answer the questions.

This was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend for collecting the enterd data has not been implimented yet. I plan 
to use Flask along with Postgres as I have expereience with them.
